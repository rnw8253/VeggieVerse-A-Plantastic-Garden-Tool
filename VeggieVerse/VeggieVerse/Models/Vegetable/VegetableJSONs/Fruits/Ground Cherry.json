    "plantName": "Ground Cherry",
    "description": "Ground cherry (Physalis pruinosa) is a small, annual fruit-bearing plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. Also known as Cape gooseberry or husk tomato, ground cherry is native to the Americas and is cultivated for its sweet, tangy fruits enclosed in papery husks. The fruits resemble small tomatoes and have a unique flavor that is often described as a blend of pineapple, tomato, and citrus. Ground cherries are commonly used fresh in salads, jams, pies, and preserves, and they can also be dried for later use.",

    "varieties": "Ground cherries, also known as Cape gooseberries or Physalis, are small, golden fruits enclosed in papery husks. Varieties of ground cherries include 'Aunt Molly's', prized for its sweet flavor and early ripening; 'Golden Nugget', known for its prolific yields and compact growth habit; 'Pineapple', which offers a unique tropical flavor reminiscent of pineapple; and 'Cossack Pineapple', valued for its large, sweet fruits. These varieties provide a range of flavors and characteristics suited for different culinary uses and growing conditions.",
    "sowingAndPlanting": {
      "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Ground cherries can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. Sow seeds in trays or pots filled with seed starting mix, covering them lightly. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide warmth and bright light for optimal germination.",
      "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Sow ground cherry seeds directly into the garden after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 60°F. Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep in well-drained soil amended with compost. Space plants 2-3 feet apart in rows spaced 3-4 feet apart.",

      "storageRecommendations": "Harvest ground cherries when the husks have turned brown and papery, and the fruit has fully ripened to a golden yellow or orange color. Store harvested ground cherries in their husks in a cool, dry place for up to several weeks. Alternatively, remove the husks and store the fruit in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.",
      "harvestDescription": "Harvest ground cherries by gently lifting the papery husks from the plant. Ripe fruit will easily detach from the stem. Collect fallen fruit regularly to prevent pests and disease."
