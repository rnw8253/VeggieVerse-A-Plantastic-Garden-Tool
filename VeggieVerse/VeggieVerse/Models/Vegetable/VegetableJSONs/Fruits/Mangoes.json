    "plantName": "Mangoes",
    "description": "Mangoes are tropical fruits prized for their sweet, juicy flesh and distinctive flavor. They are believed to be native to South Asia and are now cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Mango trees are large evergreen trees with dense foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The fruits vary in size, shape, and color depending on the variety, but they are typically oval or round with a smooth, colorful skin ranging from green to yellow, orange, or red when ripe. The flesh is juicy, fibrous, and varies in color from yellow to orange. Mangoes are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making them a nutritious addition to a balanced diet.",

    "varieties": "Mangoes come in various cultivars, each with its unique flavor, aroma, and texture. Some popular mango varieties include 'Alphonso', prized for its rich, sweet flavor, smooth texture, and vibrant yellow-orange flesh; 'Tommy Atkins', known for its mild, sweet flavor, firm flesh, and bright red and green skin; 'Kent', valued for its sweet, tropical flavor, juicy flesh, and minimal fiber content; and 'Haden', recognized for its classic mango flavor, firm flesh, and yellow-orange skin with red blush. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary uses and growing conditions.",
    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Mangoes are typically propagated from seeds. To grow from seeds, remove the seed from a ripe mango fruit and rinse it to remove any fruit flesh. Plant the seed in a pot filled with well-draining potting mix, with the rounded side down and the pointed end facing up. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide warm temperatures for germination, which may take several weeks.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Mango seeds can also be planted directly in the ground. Choose a sunny, well-drained location with fertile soil. Plant the seeds 1-2 inches deep and keep the soil consistently moist until germination occurs.",

They require regular watering, especially during dry periods, to establish and maintain healthy growth. Mulch around trees to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for deep irrigation to encourage deep root growth.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Fertilize mango trees regularly with a balanced fertilizer according to package instructions.",
        "pruningRequirements": "Prune mango trees in late winter or early spring to remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches. Thin out the canopy to improve air circulation and light penetration. Prune mature trees to maintain shape and size and encourage fruit production.",
        "supportRequirements": "Young mango trees may benefit from staking to provide support and encourage upright growth. Use sturdy stakes and ties to secure the tree in place until it establishes a strong root system."

        "timeToMaturity": "Mango trees typically begin producing fruit 3-6 years after planting, depending on the variety and growing conditions.",
        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest mangoes when they are fully ripe, usually when they have developed their characteristic color and yield slightly to gentle pressure. Cut the fruit from the tree with pruning shears, leaving a short stem attached. Store harvested mangoes at room temperature for ripening. Once ripe, refrigerate them for longer storage or freeze them for future use.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest mangoes by hand when they are fully ripe. Avoid pulling or twisting the fruit, as this can damage the tree. Cut the fruit from the tree with pruning shears, leaving a short stem attached."
