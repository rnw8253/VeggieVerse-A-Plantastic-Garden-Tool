        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Tamarillo seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. Sow seeds in pots filled with seed starting mix, planting them 1/4 inch deep. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide warmth and bright light for optimal germination.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Tamarillo seeds can also be sown directly into the garden after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 65°F. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep in well-drained soil amended with compost. Space plants according to their mature size, typically 6-10 feet apart in rows spaced 8-12 feet apart.",
