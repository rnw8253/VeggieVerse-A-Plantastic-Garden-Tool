    "plantName": "Raspberries",
    "description": "Raspberries are delicious and nutritious berries known for their sweet-tart flavor and vibrant color. They belong to the Rubus genus and are closely related to blackberries. Raspberries are native to Europe, Asia, and North America and have been cultivated for centuries for their culinary and medicinal uses. Raspberries are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making them a popular choice for fresh eating, cooking, baking, and preserving. Raspberry plants are deciduous shrubs with thorny stems and compound leaves. They produce clusters of small white flowers in spring, followed by juicy, red, black, purple, or golden berries in summer and fall.",

    "varieties": "Raspberries come in various cultivars, each with its unique flavor, color, and growth habit. Some popular raspberry varieties include 'Heritage', known for its high yields, excellent flavor, and vigorous growth; 'Autumn Bliss', prized for its late-season harvest, firm berries, and sweet-tart flavor; 'Cascade Delight', valued for its large, flavorful berries and disease resistance; and 'Nova', a cold-hardy variety with a sweet, tangy flavor and firm texture. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary uses and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Raspberries are typically propagated from dormant root cuttings or crown divisions. Prepare root cuttings or divisions in late winter or early spring when the plants are dormant. Plant them in pots filled with well-draining potting mix and keep them moist. Roots should develop within a few weeks, at which point they can be transplanted to their permanent location.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Raspberries can also be planted directly in the ground. Choose a sunny location with well-draining soil. Prepare the planting area by loosening the soil and incorporating organic matter. Plant root cuttings or divisions at the same depth they were growing previously, and water thoroughly.",

        "growingDescription": "Raspberries prefer full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil rich in organic matter. They require regular watering, especially during dry periods, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Side-dress with a balanced fertilizer once the plants are established.",
        "pruningRequirements": "Prune raspberries in late winter or early spring to remove dead, damaged, or weak canes. Thin out the canes to improve air circulation and light penetration. Raspberries produce fruit on second-year canes, so remove spent canes after harvest to make room for new growth.",
        "supportRequirements": "Raspberry canes may benefit from support, especially when laden with fruit. Install trellises, stakes, or a support system to keep the canes upright and prevent them from bending or breaking."

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest raspberries when they are fully ripe, usually when they pull away easily from the plant with a gentle tug. Pick berries frequently, as they tend to become overripe quickly. Store harvested raspberries in the refrigerator for up to a few days, or freeze them for longer storage.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest raspberries by gently pulling them from the plant when they are fully ripe. Avoid squeezing or crushing the berries, as they are delicate and prone to bruising."
