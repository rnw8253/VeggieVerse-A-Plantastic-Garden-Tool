    "plantName": "Limes",
    "description": "Limes are citrus fruits closely related to lemons, oranges, and grapefruits. They are known for their small, round green fruits with tart, acidic juice and aromatic peel. Limes are believed to be native to Southeast Asia and are now cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world. They are widely used in cooking, beverages, and household cleaning due to their refreshing flavor and high acidity. Limes are rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, and citric acid. Lime trees are evergreen shrubs or small trees with glossy green leaves and fragrant white flowers. They produce fruit year-round in warm climates and are prized for their ornamental and culinary value.",

    "varieties": "Limes come in various cultivars, each with its unique flavor, acidity, and aroma. Some popular lime varieties include 'Key Lime', prized for its intense flavor, thin skin, and high acidity; 'Persian Lime' or 'Tahiti Lime', known for its larger size, seedlessness, and milder flavor compared to Key Limes; 'Kaffir Lime', valued for its distinctive leaves used in cooking and its tart, aromatic fruit; and 'Makrut Lime', another name for Kaffir Lime. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary uses and growing conditions.",
    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Limes are typically propagated from seeds or cuttings. To grow from seeds, rinse lime seeds to remove any fruit flesh and dry them thoroughly. Plant seeds in pots filled with well-draining potting mix and keep them warm and moist. Germination may take several weeks.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Lime trees can also be propagated by cuttings. Take 6-8 inch cuttings from healthy lime trees in late winter or early spring. Remove the lower leaves and dip the cut end in rooting hormone. Plant cuttings in pots filled with well-draining potting mix and keep them warm and moist until roots develop.",

Cut the fruit from the tree with pruning shears or twist it gently until it separates from the stem. Store harvested limes at room temperature for up to one week, or refrigerate them for longer storage.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest limes by hand when they are fully ripe. Avoid pulling or twisting the fruit, as this can damage the tree. Cut the fruit from the tree with pruning shears, leaving a short stem attached."
