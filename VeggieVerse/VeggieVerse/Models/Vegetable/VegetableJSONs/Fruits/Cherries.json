    "description": "Cherries are small, round fruits belonging to the genus Prunus in the Rosaceae family. They come in two main types: sweet cherries (Prunus avium) and tart cherries (Prunus cerasus). Cherries are known for their sweet or tangy flavor and are commonly consumed fresh, dried, or processed into various products such as jams, pies, and juices. Cherry trees are deciduous and produce clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by fruit in summer. They are popular in home gardens and commercial orchards for their delicious fruit and ornamental value.",

    "varieties": "Cherries, beloved for their sweet-tart flavor and juicy texture, come in various cultivars, each with its unique taste, color, and size. Some popular cherry varieties include 'Bing', prized for its deep red color, rich flavor, and firm texture; 'Rainier', known for its yellow skin with a red blush, sweet flavor, and low acidity; 'Stella', favored for its self-fertility, early ripening, and excellent flavor; and 'Montmorency', valued for its tartness and versatility in cooking and baking. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different climates and taste preferences.",
    "sowingAndPlanting": {
      "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Cherry trees are typically propagated from rootstock rather than seeds. Obtain bare-root or container-grown cherry trees from a nursery or garden center. Plant trees in late winter or early spring while they are still dormant. Choose a sunny location with well-draining soil.",
      "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Cherry trees can also be propagated by grafting. Select a healthy scion (a young shoot or bud) from a desired cherry variety and graft it onto a compatible rootstock. Plant grafted trees in late winter or early spring in a sunny location with well-draining soil.",
