    "plantName": "Lemons",
    "description": "Lemons are citrus fruits known for their bright yellow color, sour taste, and aromatic peel. They are believed to be native to Asia and are now cultivated in many regions with warm climates, including California, Italy, and Spain. Lemons are widely used in cooking, baking, beverages, and household cleaning due to their refreshing flavor and high acidity. They are rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, and citric acid. Lemon trees are evergreen shrubs or small trees with glossy green leaves and fragrant white flowers. They produce fruit year-round in warm climates and are prized for their ornamental and culinary value.",

    "varieties": "Lemons come in various cultivars, each with its unique flavor, acidity, and juiciness. Some popular lemon varieties include 'Eureka', known for its classic lemon flavor, medium acidity, and high juice content; 'Lisbon', favored for its abundant fruit production, tart flavor, and thick skin; 'Meyer', valued for its sweeter, less acidic taste, thin skin, and ornamental qualities; and 'Limequat', a hybrid between a lime and a kumquat, prized for its tangy flavor and edible rind. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary uses and growing conditions.",
    "sowingAndPlanting": {
      "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Lemons are typically propagated from seeds or cuttings. To grow from seeds, rinse lemon seeds to remove any fruit flesh and dry them thoroughly. Plant seeds in pots filled with well-draining potting mix and keep them warm and moist. Germination may take several weeks.",
      "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Lemon trees can also be propagated by cuttings. Take 6-8 inch cuttings from healthy lemon trees in late winter or early spring. Remove the lower leaves and dip the cut end in rooting hormone. Plant cuttings in pots filled with well-draining potting mix and keep them warm and moist until roots develop.",

      "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
      "soilFertility": "Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Fertilize lemon trees with a balanced fertilizer according to package instructions.",

      "storageRecommendations": "Harvest lemons when they are fully ripe, usually when they have reached their mature color and size. Cut the fruit from the tree with pruning shears or twist it gently until it separates from the stem. Store harvested lemons at room temperature for up to one week, or refrigerate them for longer storage.",
      "harvestDescription": "Harvest lemons by hand when they are fully ripe. Avoid pulling or twisting the fruit, as this can damage the tree. Cut the fruit from the tree with pruning shears, leaving a short stem attached."
