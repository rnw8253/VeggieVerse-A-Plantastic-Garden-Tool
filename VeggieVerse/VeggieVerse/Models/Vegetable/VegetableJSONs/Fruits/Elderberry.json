    "plantName": "Elderberry",
    "description": "Elderberries are deciduous shrubs or small trees in the genus Sambucus, belonging to the Adoxaceae family. They are native to Europe, North America, and some parts of Asia. Elderberries are prized for their clusters of small, dark purple to black berries, which are rich in antioxidants and vitamins. The berries are commonly used to make jams, jellies, syrups, wines, and teas, and they have a tart, tangy flavor. Elderberry plants also have attractive white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to the garden.",

    "varieties": "Elderberries are known for their deep purple to black berries and are prized for both their culinary and medicinal uses. They come in various cultivars, each with unique flavors and growth characteristics. Some popular elderberry varieties include 'Adams', known for its large clusters of berries and vigorous growth habit; 'Black Lace', prized for its dark foliage and ornamental appeal in addition to its fruit production; 'York', which produces abundant, large berries ideal for culinary use; and 'Johns', favored for its disease resistance and consistent yields. These varieties, among others, provide a range of options suited for different purposes and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Elderberries are typically propagated from hardwood cuttings taken during the dormant season in late fall or winter. Select healthy, disease-free elderberry stems that are about pencil-thick and 1-2 years old. Cut the stems into sections about 8-12 inches long, making sure each section has at least 2-3 buds. Plant the cuttings in well-drained soil, burying them halfway and spacing them about 6 feet apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until roots establish, which typically takes 1-2 months.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Elderberries can also be propagated by direct seeding or transplanting nursery-grown plants. Choose a site with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist until germination, which usually takes 2-3 weeks. Transplant nursery-grown elderberry plants in late fall or early spring, spacing them 6 feet apart in rows spaced 8 feet apart.",

Water newly planted elderberries regularly to keep the soil consistently moist. Mulch around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain soil temperature.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, especially during dry periods, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and again after flowering.",
        "pruningRequirements": "Prune elderberries in late winter or early spring to remove dead, diseased, or weak branches. Thin out crowded growth and prune for shape. Elderberries produce fruit on second-year wood, so prune older branches to encourage new growth and fruiting.",
