        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Apricot trees are typically propagated from grafted saplings rather than grown from seeds. Purchase young apricot trees from a reputable nursery or garden center, selecting varieties suitable for your climate and growing conditions.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Plant apricot trees in late winter or early spring before bud break. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball of the tree and backfill with soil, ensuring the graft union is above the soil line. Space trees according to their mature size, typically 15-20 feet apart.",
