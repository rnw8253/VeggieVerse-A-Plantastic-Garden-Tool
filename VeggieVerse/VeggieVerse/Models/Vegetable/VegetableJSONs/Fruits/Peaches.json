    "plantName": "Peaches",
    "description": "Peaches are juicy, sweet fruits with a fuzzy skin and a large, hard pit in the center. They are believed to be native to Northwest China, where they have been cultivated for thousands of years. Peaches are now grown in many temperate regions around the world and are prized for their delicious flavor and versatility. They are commonly eaten fresh, canned, or used in jams, pies, and desserts. Peach trees are deciduous trees with lanceolate leaves and pink flowers. They produce fruit in summer and are popular choices for home orchards and landscaping.",

    "varieties": "Peaches come in various cultivars, each with its unique flavor, sweetness, and texture. Some popular peach varieties include 'Elberta', known for its large size, firm texture, and classic peach flavor; 'Georgia Belle', prized for its juicy, aromatic fruit and semi-freestone pit; 'Red Haven', valued for its early ripening, firm flesh, and sweet-tart flavor; and 'Saturn' or 'Donut Peach', characterized by its flattened shape, sweet flavor, and small pit. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary uses and growing conditions.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Peaches are typically propagated from seeds or by grafting. To grow from seeds, rinse peach seeds to remove any fruit pulp and dry them thoroughly. Plant seeds in pots filled with well-draining potting mix and keep them warm and moist. Germination may take several weeks. Alternatively, purchase grafted peach trees from a nursery for faster fruit production.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Peach trees should be planted in well-draining soil in a sunny location. Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball of the tree and backfill with soil, making sure the tree is planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery container. Water thoroughly after planting.",

       "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
       "soilFertility": "Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Fertilize peach trees with a balanced fertilizer according to package instructions, avoiding excessive nitrogen.",
       "pruningRequirements": "Prune peach trees in late winter or early spring to remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches. Thin out the canopy to improve air circulation and light penetration. Prune mature trees to maintain shape and size, and to encourage fruit production on younger wood.",
       "supportRequirements": "Young peach trees may benefit from staking to provide support and prevent leaning. Use sturdy stakes and ties to secure the tree in place until it establishes a strong root system."

       "storageRecommendations": "Harvest peaches when they are fully ripe, usually when the skin develops a rich color and the fruit yields slightly to gentle pressure. Twist the fruit gently or cut it from the tree with pruning shears, leaving a short stem attached. Store harvested peaches at room temperature for a few days, or refrigerate them for longer storage.",
       "harvestDescription": "Harvest peaches by hand when they are fully ripe. Avoid pulling or twisting the fruit forcefully, as this can damage the tree or cause bruising. Cut the fruit from the tree with pruning shears, leaving a short stem attached."
