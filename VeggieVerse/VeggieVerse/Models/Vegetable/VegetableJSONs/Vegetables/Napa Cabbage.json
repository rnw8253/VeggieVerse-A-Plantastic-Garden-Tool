Transplant seedlings outdoors once they are well-established and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Napa cabbage seeds can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 12-18 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
