    "varieties": "Napa cabbage, also known as Chinese cabbage, comes in several varieties, each with its unique leaf shape, color, and flavor. Common varieties of Napa cabbage include 'Michihili', known for its long cylindrical shape and crisp texture; 'Wong Bok', prized for its compact head and sweet flavor; and 'Blues', which offers a slightly savoyed texture and mild taste. These varieties provide a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Napa cabbage can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors once they are well-established and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Napa cabbage seeds can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 12-18 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
