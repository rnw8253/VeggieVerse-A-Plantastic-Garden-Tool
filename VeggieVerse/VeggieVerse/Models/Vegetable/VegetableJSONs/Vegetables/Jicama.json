    "varieties": "Jicama, also known as Mexican turnip or yam bean, does not have as many varieties as other crops. However, there are some cultivars that vary slightly in shape, size, and taste. Common varieties of jicama include 'Mexican Red', 'Cachucha', and 'Mexican Cream'. These varieties generally produce large, round tubers with crisp, white flesh and a mildly sweet flavor.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Jicama is typically grown from seeds directly sown outdoors rather than started indoors. However, if you want to get a head start on the growing season, you can start seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with potting mix. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-85°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Jicama seeds should be sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them 6-12 inches apart in rows spaced 12-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest jicama when the vines start to die back and the tubers reach a desirable size (usually 3-6 months after planting). Carefully dig up the tubers, being careful not to damage them. Wash the tubers thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. Store harvested jicama in a cool, dry place with good air circulation. It can be stored for several weeks to several months.",
