    "varieties": "Cabbage comes in various shapes, sizes, and colors, with each variety offering unique flavors and culinary uses. Some popular cabbage varieties include 'Green Acre', known for its dense, round heads and traditional cabbage flavor; 'Red Express', prized for its vibrant red-purple color and sweet flavor; 'Savoy', valued for its crinkled leaves and mild, sweet taste; and 'Napa', recognized for its elongated shape and delicate flavor. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Cabbage is typically started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in trays or pots filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (65-75°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Cabbage can also be directly sown outdoors in early spring or late summer. Prepare a seedbed with loose, fertile soil and sow seeds 1/4 inch deep. Space seeds or thin seedlings to the desired spacing, allowing enough room for plants to grow to full size. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

       "growingDescription": "Cabbage prefers full sun and well-draining soil rich in organic matter. It requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
       "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
       "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Fertilize cabbage plants with a balanced fertilizer once they become established.",

       "storageRecommendations": "Harvest cabbage when the heads are firm and solid, typically 6-10 inches in diameter. Cut the head from the stem with a sharp knife, leaving a few outer leaves attached to protect the head. Store harvested cabbage in the refrigerator for up to a few weeks. Wash and dry the heads before storing to remove any dirt or debris.",
       "harvestDescription": "Harvest cabbage by cutting the head from the stem when it is firm and solid. Avoid letting the heads become loose or start to split, as this can negatively affect flavor and storage life."
