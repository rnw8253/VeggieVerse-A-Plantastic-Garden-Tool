    "varieties": "Kohlrabi, a member of the cabbage family, comes in several varieties, each with its unique characteristics and culinary uses. Common varieties of kohlrabi include 'Early White Vienna', known for its pale green skin and tender flesh; 'Purple Vienna', recognized for its vibrant purple skin and slightly sweeter flavor; and 'Kolibri', prized for its purple-and-white bi-colored skin. These varieties offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Kohlrabi seeds can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Kohlrabi seeds can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and space them 4-6 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
