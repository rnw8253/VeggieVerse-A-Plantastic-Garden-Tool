     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Kale can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Kale can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and space them 12-18 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
