    "varieties": "Beets come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, with each variety offering unique flavors and culinary uses. Some popular beet varieties include 'Detroit Dark Red', known for its deep red color and sweet, earthy flavor; 'Chioggia', valued for its candy-striped flesh and mild taste; 'Golden', prized for its bright yellow color and sweet flavor; and 'Cylindra', recognized for its cylindrical shape and tender texture. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Beets are best sown directly into the garden, but if starting indoors, use biodegradable pots to avoid disturbing the roots during transplanting. Plant seeds 1/2 inch deep in moist, well-draining soil. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide bright, indirect light. Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed a few true leaves.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Beets should be directly sown into the garden in early spring for a spring harvest or in late summer for a fall harvest. Prepare a seedbed with loose, fertile soil and sow seeds 1/2 inch deep, spacing them according to the desired size of the mature beets. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

Use a garden fork to gently lift the beets from the soil, taking care not to damage the roots. Trim off the tops, leaving about an inch of stem, and store beets in the refrigerator for up to a few weeks.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest beets by gently lifting them from the soil using a garden fork when they reach the desired size. Twist off the tops, leaving about an inch of stem attached, to prevent bleeding during cooking."
