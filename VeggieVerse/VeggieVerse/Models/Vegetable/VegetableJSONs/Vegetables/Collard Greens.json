    "varieties": "Collard greens come in several varieties, each with its unique characteristics and culinary uses. Some popular collard greens varieties include 'Georgia Southern', known for its large, smooth leaves and mild flavor; 'Champion', valued for its disease resistance and vigorous growth; 'Flash', recognized for its tender leaves and quick maturity; and 'Vates', prized for its dark green, crinkled leaves and cold tolerance. These varieties offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Collard greens are typically directly sown outdoors as they do not transplant well. Plant seeds in well-prepared, fertile soil that is free from weeds and debris. Sow seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and space them according to the recommended distance for the variety being grown. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Collard greens can be sown outdoors as soon as the soil can be worked in early spring. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and space them according to the recommended distance for the variety being grown. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

They require regular watering, especially during dry periods, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
       "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
       "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Fertilize collard greens with a balanced fertilizer once they become established.",

       "storageRecommendations": "Harvest collard greens when the leaves are large and tender, typically 8-10 inches long. Cut the leaves from the outer edges of the plant, leaving the inner leaves to continue growing. Store harvested collard greens in the refrigerator for up to a week. Wash and dry the leaves before storing to remove any dirt or debris.",
