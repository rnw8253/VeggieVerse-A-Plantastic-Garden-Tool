However, if you want to get a head start on the growing season, you can start seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with potting mix. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they are well-established and the weather has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Mustard greens seeds should be sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-12 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
