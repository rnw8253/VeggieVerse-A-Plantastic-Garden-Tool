    "varieties": "Mustard greens come in several varieties, each with its unique leaf shape, color, and flavor. Common varieties of mustard greens include 'Southern Giant Curled', known for its large, frilly leaves and peppery flavor; 'Red Giant', prized for its vibrant red-purple leaves and spicy taste; and 'Tendergreen', which offers tender, mild-flavored leaves. These varieties provide a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Mustard greens are typically grown from seeds directly sown outdoors rather than started indoors. However, if you want to get a head start on the growing season, you can start seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with potting mix. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they are well-established and the weather has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Mustard greens seeds should be sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-12 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
