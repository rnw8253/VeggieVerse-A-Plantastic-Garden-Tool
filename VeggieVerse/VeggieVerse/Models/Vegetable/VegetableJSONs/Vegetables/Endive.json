    "varieties": "Endive, also known as escarole, comes in several varieties, each with its unique characteristics and culinary uses. Some popular endive varieties include 'Escarole', known for its broad, slightly bitter leaves and versatility in salads and cooked dishes; 'Frisee', recognized for its finely cut, curly leaves and slightly peppery flavor; and 'Batavian', prized for its large, crisp leaves and mild taste. These varieties offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Endive can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Endive can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-drained soil and partial shade. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them according to the recommended distance for the variety being grown. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
