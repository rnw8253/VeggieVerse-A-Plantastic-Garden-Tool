Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Endive can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-drained soil and partial shade. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them according to the recommended distance for the variety being grown. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
