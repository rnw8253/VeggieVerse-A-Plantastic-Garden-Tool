        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Onions can be started indoors from seeds or sets (small bulbs). Plant seeds or sets in pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 1 inch apart. Keep the soil consistently moist and warm (65-75°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed strong roots and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Onions can also be directly sown outdoors in well-drained soil once the soil can be worked. Choose a sunny location with fertile soil. Plant seeds or sets 1/4 inch deep and space them 4-6 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
