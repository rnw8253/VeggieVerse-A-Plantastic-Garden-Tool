        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Tomatoes are typically started from seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-75°F). Provide ample light or use supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Tomatoes can also be directly seeded outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 18-24 inches apart in rows spaced 3-4 feet apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
