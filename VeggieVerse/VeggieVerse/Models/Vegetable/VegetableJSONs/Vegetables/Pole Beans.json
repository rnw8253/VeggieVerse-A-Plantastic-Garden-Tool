    "plantName": "Pole Beans",
    "description": "Pole beans, also known as climbing beans or runner beans, are a type of bean plant characterized by their long, trailing vines that require support structures such as poles or trellises to grow upright. They belong to the Phaseolus genus and are cultivated for their edible pods and seeds. Pole beans are popular in home gardens and are valued for their productivity, flavor, and nutritional content. They come in various colors and sizes, with common varieties including green, yellow, and purple pods.",

    "varieties": "Pole beans, also known as climbing beans or runner beans, come in various types, each with its unique flavor, pod color, and growth habit. Common varieties of pole beans include 'Kentucky Wonder', known for its long, straight pods and excellent flavor; 'Blue Lake', prized for its tender pods and high yield; and 'Scarlet Runner', which offers ornamental red flowers and flavorful beans. These varieties provide a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Pole beans are best sown directly outdoors rather than started indoors. However, if you want to get a head start on the growing season, you can start seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-80°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they are well-established and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Pole beans should be sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them 4-6 inches apart along a trellis or support structure. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
