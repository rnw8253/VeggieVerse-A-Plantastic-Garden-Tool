    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Swiss chard is best sown directly outdoors rather than started indoors. However, if you want to get a head start on the growing season, you can start Swiss chard seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1/2 inch deep and space them 2-3 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-80°F). Transplant Swiss chard seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Swiss chard seeds should be sown directly outdoors as soon as the soil can be worked in the spring. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/2 inch deep and space them 6-12 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
