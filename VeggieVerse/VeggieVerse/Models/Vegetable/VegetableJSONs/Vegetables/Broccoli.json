    "varieties": "Broccoli comes in several varieties, each with its unique characteristics, including head size, color, and flavor. Some popular broccoli varieties include 'Calabrese', known for its large, domed heads and traditional broccoli flavor; 'Belstar', prized for its early maturity and tight, dark green heads; 'De Cicco', valued for its smaller heads and extended harvest period; and 'Purple Sprouting', recognized for its purple heads and tender shoots. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Broccoli is typically started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in trays or pots filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (65-75°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Broccoli can also be directly sown outdoors in early spring or late summer. Prepare a seedbed with loose, fertile soil and sow seeds 1/4 inch deep. Space seeds or thin seedlings to the desired spacing, allowing enough room for plants to grow to full size. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

       "storageRecommendations": "Harvest broccoli when the heads are tight and firm, typically 4-8 inches in diameter. Cut the main head with a sharp knife, leaving a few inches of stem attached to the plant. Side shoots will continue to develop after the main head is harvested, providing additional harvests. Store harvested broccoli in the refrigerator for up to a week. Wash and dry the heads before storing to remove any dirt or debris.",
       "harvestDescription": "Harvest broccoli by cutting the main head when it is tight and firm, using a sharp knife to make a clean cut. Avoid letting the heads become loose or start to flower, as this can negatively affect flavor and texture."
