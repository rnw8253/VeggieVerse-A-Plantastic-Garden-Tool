        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Squash seeds can be started indoors 3-4 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Use biodegradable pots or seed starting trays filled with seed starting mix. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (around 70°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Directly sow squash seeds outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up. Choose a sunny location with well-draining soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them according to the recommended spacing for the specific variety. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
