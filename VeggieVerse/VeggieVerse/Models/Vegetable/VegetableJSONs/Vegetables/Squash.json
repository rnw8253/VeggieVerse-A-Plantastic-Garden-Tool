    "varieties": "Squash is a diverse group of vegetables belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family, encompassing various species and cultivars. Common types of squash include summer squash such as zucchini and yellow squash, as well as winter squash like butternut squash, acorn squash, and spaghetti squash. Each type of squash comes in different varieties, offering a range of shapes, colors, sizes, and flavors. Some popular squash varieties include 'Black Beauty' zucchini, 'Golden Glory' yellow squash, 'Waltham' butternut squash, and 'Table Queen' acorn squash.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Some varieties of squash, particularly those with a long growing season or in regions with short summers, can benefit from starting seeds indoors. Use biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep them consistently moist and warm (70-85°F). Transplant squash seedlings outdoors after the last frost date, ensuring they have adequate space to spread.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Squash seeds are typically sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them according to the specific variety's requirements, usually 18-36 inches apart in rows spaced 3-6 feet apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

They prefer well-drained, fertile soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Squash plants need regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulching around plants can help retain moisture and suppress weeds.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest summer squash when they are young and tender, usually 6-8 inches long. Winter squash should be harvested when the skin hardens and develops a deep, solid color. Use a sharp knife to cut squash from the vine, leaving a short stem attached. Store harvested squash in a cool, dry place with good air circulation. Winter squash can be stored for several months if kept in optimal conditions.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest squash regularly to encourage continued production throughout the growing season. Cut summer squash when they are still tender and easy to pierce with a fingernail. For winter squash, leave them on the vine until fully mature, indicated by a hard rind and the inability to puncture the skin with a fingernail."
