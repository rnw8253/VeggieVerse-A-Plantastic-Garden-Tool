        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Pumpkin seeds can be started indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix if you want to get a head start on the growing season. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-85°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed strong roots and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Pumpkin seeds should be sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them 2-3 feet apart in rows spaced 4-8 feet apart, depending on the variety's spread. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
