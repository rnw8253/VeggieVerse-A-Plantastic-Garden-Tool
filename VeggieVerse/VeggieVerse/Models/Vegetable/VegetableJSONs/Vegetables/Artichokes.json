    "varieties": "Artichokes come in various cultivars, each with its unique flavor, size, and shape. Some popular artichoke varieties include 'Green Globe', prized for its large, tender buds and classic artichoke flavor; 'Imperial Star', known for its early harvest and compact growth habit; 'Purple of Romagna', valued for its purple-tinged leaves and deep-flavored hearts; and 'Violetta di Chioggia', a heirloom variety with striking purple buds and sweet, nutty flavor. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary uses and growing conditions.",

       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Artichokes are typically propagated from seeds. Start seeds indoors 8-12 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in pots filled with well-draining potting mix and keep them warm and moist. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Artichokes can also be directly sown outdoors in mild climates. Plant seeds in well-prepared soil, spacing them according to the variety's mature size. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
