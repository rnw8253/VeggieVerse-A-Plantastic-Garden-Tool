    "plantName": "Tomatillo",
    "description": "Tomatillo, also known as Mexican husk tomato, is a member of the nightshade family native to Mexico and Central America. It produces small, round fruits enclosed in papery husks. Tomatillos have a tart, citrusy flavor and are a key ingredient in many Mexican and Latin American dishes, including salsa verde and various sauces. They are easy to grow and can be harvested when the husks turn brown and the fruits fill out.",

    "varieties": "Tatsoi, also known as spoon mustard or spinach mustard, is a leafy green vegetable with tender, spoon-shaped leaves and a mild, mustard-like flavor. It is commonly used in salads, stir-fries, and soups. While there are not as many recognized varieties of tatsoi as other vegetables, some common types include 'Tatsoi Rosette', known for its compact growth habit and vibrant green leaves, and 'Tatsoi Savoy', which offers heavily ruffled leaves and a sweeter taste. These varieties provide options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Tatsoi is best sown directly outdoors rather than started indoors. However, if you want to get a head start on the growing season, you can start tatsoi seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 1-2 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist and warm (60-70°F). Transplant tatsoi seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Tatsoi seeds should be sown directly outdoors as soon as the soil can be worked in the spring. Choose a location with partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 4-6 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest tatsoi when the leaves are young and tender, usually before they start to bolt (produce flowers). Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the outer leaves, allowing the inner leaves to continue growing. Store harvested tatsoi in the refrigerator for up to a week.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest tatsoi when the leaves are large enough to use, usually when they are 4-6 inches long. Cut the outer leaves first, leaving the center leaves to continue growing. Rinse the tatsoi thoroughly to remove any soil before storing or using it."

        "Fertilize tomatillos with a balanced fertilizer or compost tea every 3-4 weeks, following package instructions.",
        "Stake or cage tomatillo plants to support their sprawling growth habit and keep fruits off the ground.",
        "Monitor plants regularly for signs of pests such as aphids and flea beetles. Use row covers or insecticidal soap as needed.",
        "Watch for symptoms of diseases like early blight and powdery mildew. Provide good air circulation and avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around plants.",
        "Harvest tomatillos when the husks turn brown and papery and the fruits fill out, typically 70-80 days after planting. Twist or cut the fruits from the stems and remove the husks before using."
