Keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate and seedlings emerge.",
      "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Fava beans can be sown outdoors as soon as the soil can be worked in early spring. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 to 2 inches deep and 4 to 6 inches apart in rows spaced 18 to 24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate and seedlings emerge.",
