    "varieties": "Fava beans, also known as broad beans, come in various varieties, each with its unique characteristics and culinary uses. Some popular fava bean varieties include 'Windsor', known for its reliability and high yield; 'Aquadulce', prized for its early harvest and large beans; 'Bunyard's Exhibition', recognized for its long pods and flavorful beans; and 'Superaguadulce', valued for its cold tolerance and excellent flavor. These varieties offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
    "sowingAndPlanting": {
      "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Fava beans are typically directly sown outdoors as they do not transplant well. Plant seeds directly in the garden bed in early spring, 1 to 2 inches deep and 4 to 6 inches apart. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate and seedlings emerge.",
      "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Fava beans can be sown outdoors as soon as the soil can be worked in early spring. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 to 2 inches deep and 4 to 6 inches apart in rows spaced 18 to 24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate and seedlings emerge.",

They require regular watering, especially during dry periods, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
      "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
      "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Fertilize fava beans with a balanced fertilizer once they start flowering.",

      "storageRecommendations": "Harvest fava beans when the pods are plump and firm but still young, usually before they become tough and fibrous. Cut the pods from the plant using scissors or a sharp knife. Store harvested fava beans in the refrigerator for up to a week. Shell the beans just before using them.",
      "harvestDescription": "Harvest fava beans by cutting the pods from the plant when they are mature and plump. Remove the beans from the pods and discard any damaged or discolored beans. Fava beans can be eaten fresh, cooked, or dried for later use."
