    "varieties": "Escarole, a type of endive, is known for its broad, slightly bitter leaves and versatility in salads and cooked dishes. Some popular escarole varieties include 'Broadleaf Batavian', recognized for its large, crisp leaves and mild taste; 'Full Heart', prized for its compact, dense heads and tender leaves; and 'Natacha', valued for its uniform growth and resistance to bolting. These varieties offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Escarole can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Escarole can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-drained soil and partial shade. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them according to the recommended distance for the variety being grown. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Side-dress escarole with a balanced fertilizer once it starts growing.",

Cut the outer leaves from the plant using scissors or a sharp knife, allowing the inner leaves to continue growing. Store harvested escarole in the refrigerator for up to a week. Wash and dry the leaves before storing to remove any dirt or debris.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest escarole by cutting the outer leaves from the plant as needed. Leave the inner leaves to continue growing, and harvest them as they reach the desired size."
