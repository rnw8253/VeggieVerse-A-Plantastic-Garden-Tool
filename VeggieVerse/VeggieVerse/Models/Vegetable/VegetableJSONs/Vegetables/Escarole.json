Some popular escarole varieties include 'Broadleaf Batavian', recognized for its large, crisp leaves and mild taste; 'Full Heart', prized for its compact, dense heads and tender leaves; and 'Natacha', valued for its uniform growth and resistance to bolting. These varieties offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Escarole can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Escarole can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-drained soil and partial shade. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them according to the recommended distance for the variety being grown. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
