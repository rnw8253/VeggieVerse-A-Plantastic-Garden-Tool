Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (60-70°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Leeks can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil is workable and the danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained, fertile soil. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
