    "varieties": "Brussels sprouts come in various varieties, each offering unique characteristics such as head size, flavor, and maturity time. Some popular Brussels sprouts varieties include 'Long Island Improved', known for its large, firm sprouts and excellent flavor; 'Jade Cross', prized for its early maturity and uniform sprouts; 'Diablo', recognized for its red-tinged leaves and sweet, nutty flavor; and 'Falstaff', valued for its disease resistance and compact plant size. These varieties, among others, provide a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Brussels sprouts are typically started indoors 12-14 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in trays or pots filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (65-75°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Brussels sprouts can also be directly sown outdoors in early spring or mid-summer. Prepare a seedbed with loose, fertile soil and sow seeds 1/4 inch deep. Space seeds or thin seedlings to the desired spacing, allowing enough room for plants to grow to full size. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Fertilize Brussels sprouts with a balanced fertilizer once they become established.",

Start harvesting from the bottom of the stalk, working upward as the sprouts mature. Cut the sprouts from the stem with a sharp knife or scissors. Store harvested Brussels sprouts in the refrigerator for up to a week. Remove any yellowing or damaged outer leaves before storing.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest Brussels sprouts by cutting the sprouts from the stem with a sharp knife or scissors when they reach the desired size and firmness. Avoid letting the sprouts become loose or start to flower, as this can negatively affect flavor and texture."
