    "plantName": "Peas",
    "description": "Peas are cool-season vegetables that belong to the legume family. They are prized for their sweet flavor and tender texture, and they are commonly eaten fresh or cooked. Peas come in various types, including shelling peas, snap peas, and snow peas, each with its unique characteristics and culinary uses. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein, making them a nutritious addition to any diet.",

    "varieties": "Peas come in various types, including shelling peas (also known as garden peas), snow peas, and sugar snap peas. Common varieties of shelling peas include 'Green Arrow', known for its high yields and sweet flavor; 'Little Marvel', prized for its compact growth habit and early maturity; and 'Wando', which offers good heat tolerance and continuous production. Snow peas are typically harvested for their flat, edible pods, with popular varieties including 'Oregon Sugar Pod' and 'Snowbird'. Sugar snap peas, which have edible pods with sweet peas inside, include varieties like 'Sugar Ann' and 'Super Sugar Snap'. These varieties provide a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Peas are typically direct-sown outdoors rather than started indoors. However, you can start seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix if you want to get a head start on the growing season. Plant seeds 1-2 inches deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (55-65°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed strong roots and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Peas should be sown directly outdoors as soon as the soil can be worked in early spring. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1-2 inches deep and space them 2-4 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "growingDescription": "Peas prefer full sun but can tolerate some shade, especially in hot climates. They require well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Peas have shallow roots, so regular watering is essential to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Peas are nitrogen-fixing plants, so they have relatively low fertilizer requirements. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, as they can promote excessive foliage growth at the expense of pod development.",
        "pruningRequirements": "Peas generally do not require pruning. However, you can pinch off the growing tips once the plants reach their desired height to encourage bushier growth and more lateral branching.",
        "supportRequirements": "Peas are climbing plants and require support to grow vertically. Install trellises, stakes, or pea netting at the time of planting to provide support for the vines as they grow."

They reproduce rapidly and can cause distorted growth, yellowing, and wilting. To control pea aphids, spray affected plants with water to dislodge them, introduce natural predators like ladybugs or lacewings, and use insecticidal soap or neem oil as needed."

It thrives in warm, humid conditions and can lead to reduced plant vigor and yield. Prevent powdery mildew by providing good air circulation around plants, avoiding overhead watering, and applying fungicidal sprays as needed."
