    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Bell peppers are typically started indoors 8-10 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in trays or pots filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-80째F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Bell peppers can be directly sown outdoors in areas with long growing seasons and warm temperatures. Wait until after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up to at least 60째F. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep in well-prepared soil and keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
