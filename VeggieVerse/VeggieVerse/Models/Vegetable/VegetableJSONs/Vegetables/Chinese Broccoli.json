    "varieties": "Chinese broccoli, also known as gai lan or kai-lan, comes in several varieties, each with its unique characteristics and culinary uses. Some popular Chinese broccoli varieties include 'Green Lance', which has tender, thick stems and glossy green leaves; 'Kailaan', prized for its sweet and slightly bitter flavor; and 'Kai-Lan Gau', which has thicker stems and is well-suited for stir-frying. These varieties offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Chinese broccoli is typically directly sown outdoors as it does not transplant well. Plant seeds directly into well-prepared, fertile soil in the garden bed. Sow seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and cover lightly with soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Chinese broccoli can be sown directly outdoors in early spring or late summer. Prepare a garden bed with loose, well-draining soil and sow seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep. Space seeds or thin seedlings to the desired spacing, allowing enough room for plants to grow to full size. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
