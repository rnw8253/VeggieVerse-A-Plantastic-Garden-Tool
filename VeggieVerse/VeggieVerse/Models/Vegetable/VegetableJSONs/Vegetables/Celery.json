    "plantName": "Celery",
    "description": "Celery is a biennial vegetable prized for its crunchy stalks and distinctive flavor. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is closely related to carrots, parsley, and fennel. Celery is a versatile ingredient in culinary dishes, commonly used raw in salads, soups, and snacks, or cooked in stews, stir-fries, and casseroles.",

    "varieties": "Celery comes in different varieties, each offering unique flavors and characteristics. Some popular celery varieties include 'Giant Pascal', known for its large, crisp stalks and strong celery flavor; 'Golden Self-Blanching', prized for its pale green stalks and mild taste; 'Redventure', valued for its red stalks and robust flavor; and 'Tango', recognized for its uniform growth and excellent flavor. These varieties, among others, provide options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Celery is typically started indoors 10-12 weeks before the last frost date. Sow seeds in trays or pots filled with a seed starting mix, pressing them lightly into the surface. Keep the soil consistently moist and maintain a temperature of around 70°F for optimal germination. Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Celery can also be directly sown outdoors in early spring after the danger of frost has passed. Prepare a seedbed with loose, fertile soil and sow seeds 1/8 to 1/4 inch deep. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge. Thin seedlings to the desired spacing once they have developed their first true leaves.",
