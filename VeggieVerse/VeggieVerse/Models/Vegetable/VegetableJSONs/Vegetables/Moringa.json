    "plantName": "Moringa",
    "description": "Moringa, also known as the drumstick tree or horseradish tree, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is valued for its edible leaves, nutritious seed pods, and medicinal properties. Moringa leaves are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making them a valuable addition to the diet. The seed pods, known as drumsticks, can be cooked and eaten like green beans, while the seeds can be pressed to extract moringa oil or ground into a nutritious powder. Moringa trees are easy to grow in tropical and subtropical climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making them an excellent choice for sustainable agriculture and food security.",

    "varieties": "Moringa, also known as the drumstick tree or horseradish tree, comes in several varieties, although the most commonly cultivated is Moringa oleifera. While there are some regional variations in Moringa, they generally share similar characteristics. Moringa oleifera is widely recognized for its fast growth, drought tolerance, and nutritional value.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Moringa seeds can be started indoors in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-90°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors once they are well-established and the weather has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Moringa seeds can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them 6-12 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

       "growingDescription": "Moringa thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, to establish and grow. Once established, Moringa is drought-tolerant and does not require frequent watering. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
       "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering until established; drought-tolerant once mature.",
       "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Side-dress with compost or organic fertilizer during the growing season to provide additional nutrients.",
       "pruningRequirements": "Moringa benefits from regular pruning to promote branching and increase yield. Prune back the main stem when the plant reaches about 3 feet in height to encourage lateral growth. Remove any dead or damaged branches as needed.",
       "supportRequirements": "Young Moringa plants may benefit from staking or support until they become established. Once established, Moringa typically does not require support."

       "storageRecommendations": "Harvest Moringa leaves and pods as needed for fresh consumption. Leaves can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week or frozen for longer storage. Pods should be harvested when young and tender for the best flavor and texture.",
       "harvestDescription": "Harvest Moringa leaves by pruning the outer branches, leaving the inner branches to continue growing. Harvest pods when they are young and tender, typically around 6-12 inches in length."
