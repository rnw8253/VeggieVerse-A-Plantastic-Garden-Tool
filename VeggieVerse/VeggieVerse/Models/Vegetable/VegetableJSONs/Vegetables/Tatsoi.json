    "description": "Tatsoi, also known as spoon mustard or rosette bok choy, is a leafy green vegetable native to Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Tatsoi forms compact, rosette-shaped heads with dark green, spoon-shaped leaves. It has a mild, mustard-like flavor and is commonly used in salads, stir-fries, soups, and other Asian dishes. Tatsoi is easy to grow and can be harvested as baby greens or allowed to mature into full-size plants.",

    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Tatsoi can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Sow seeds in seed trays or pots filled with well-draining potting mix. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist until germination, which typically takes 7-14 days. Once the seedlings have developed several sets of true leaves, they can be transplanted outdoors.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Tatsoi is typically directly sown outdoors in the garden. Choose a sunny to partially shaded location with well-draining soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-8 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until germination.",

Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, as tatsoi does not tolerate standing water. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and keep the soil temperature consistent.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, 1-2 inches per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Side-dress with a balanced fertilizer once the plants are established.",

Cut the outer leaves with sharp scissors or pruning shears, leaving the inner leaves to continue growing. Store harvested tatsoi in the refrigerator for up to one week in a plastic bag or container lined with paper towels to absorb excess moisture.",
