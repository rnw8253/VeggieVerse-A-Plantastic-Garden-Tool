    "plantName": "Tatsoi",
    "description": "Tatsoi, also known as spoon mustard or rosette bok choy, is a leafy green vegetable native to Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Tatsoi forms compact, rosette-shaped heads with dark green, spoon-shaped leaves. It has a mild, mustard-like flavor and is commonly used in salads, stir-fries, soups, and other Asian dishes. Tatsoi is easy to grow and can be harvested as baby greens or allowed to mature into full-size plants.",

    "varieties": "Tatsoi, also known as spoon mustard or rosette bok choy, is available in various varieties, each with its unique leaf shape, color, and flavor. Common tatsoi varieties include 'Tatsoi Rosette', known for its compact rosette shape and tender, dark green leaves; 'Tatsoi Red', which offers a striking reddish-purple coloration in its leaves; and 'Tatsoi Baby', prized for its small, delicate leaves ideal for salads and garnishes. These varieties provide options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Tatsoi is best sown directly outdoors rather than started indoors. However, if you wish to start tatsoi seeds indoors, you can do so in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 2-3 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist and warm (65-75°F). Transplant tatsoi seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Tatsoi seeds should be sown directly outdoors as soon as the soil can be worked in the spring or late summer. Choose a location with well-drained soil and partial shade. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-8 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

      "Fertilize tatsoi with a balanced fertilizer or compost tea every 3-4 weeks, following package instructions.",
      "Monitor plants regularly for signs of pests such as flea beetles and aphids. Use row covers or insecticidal soap as needed.",
      "Watch for symptoms of diseases like downy mildew and powdery mildew. Provide good air circulation and avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around plants.",
      "Harvest tatsoi when the leaves are large enough to use, typically 30-40 days after planting. Harvest outer leaves first, leaving the center leaves to continue growing."
