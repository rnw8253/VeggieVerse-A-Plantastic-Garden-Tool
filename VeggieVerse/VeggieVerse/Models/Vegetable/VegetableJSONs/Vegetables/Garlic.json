    "varieties": "Garlic comes in two main types: hardneck and softneck. Hardneck garlic varieties are known for their larger cloves, complex flavors, and scapes (flower stalks) that curl as they grow. Some popular hardneck varieties include 'German Red', 'Spanish Roja', and 'Music'. Softneck garlic varieties are characterized by their smaller cloves and longer storage life. Common softneck varieties include 'California Early', 'Inchelium Red', and 'Silverskin'. Each variety offers a unique flavor profile and adapts to different growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Garlic cloves are typically planted outdoors directly into the soil in the fall, but they can also be started indoors in pots or trays filled with potting mix. Plant individual cloves 2 inches deep and 4-6 inches apart, with the pointed end facing up. Keep the soil consistently moist and place the containers in a cool location with indirect sunlight. Transplant the garlic outdoors once the shoots are well-established.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Plant garlic cloves outdoors in the fall, about 4-6 weeks before the first frost date. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Break apart the garlic bulbs into individual cloves and plant them 2 inches deep and 4-6 inches apart, with the pointed end facing up. Cover the cloves with soil and mulch to protect them from winter weather.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest garlic when the tops begin to yellow and fall over. Carefully dig up the bulbs using a garden fork, being careful not to damage them. Allow the bulbs to dry in a well-ventilated area out of direct sunlight for 2-3 weeks. Once dry, trim the roots and tops, leaving about an inch of stem attached. Store garlic bulbs in a cool, dry place with good air circulation.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest garlic by gently loosening the soil around the bulbs and lifting them from the ground. Allow the bulbs to cure before storing them."
