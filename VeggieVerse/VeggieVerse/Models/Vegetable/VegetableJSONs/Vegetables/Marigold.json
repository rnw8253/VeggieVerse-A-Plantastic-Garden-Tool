        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Marigolds can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in well-draining potting mix and keep them moist until germination. Once seedlings have developed true leaves, transplant them into individual containers or cell packs.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Marigolds can also be directly sown outdoors after the last frost date. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Sow seeds thinly and cover lightly with soil. Keep the soil evenly moist until seedlings emerge.",
