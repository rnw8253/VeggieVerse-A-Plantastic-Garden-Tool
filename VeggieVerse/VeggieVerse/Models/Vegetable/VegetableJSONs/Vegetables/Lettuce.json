    "varieties": "Lettuce comes in various types, each offering unique flavors, textures, and colors. Some common types of lettuce include 'Butterhead' (e.g., 'Bibb', 'Boston'), known for its tender leaves and buttery texture; 'Crisphead' (e.g., 'Iceberg'), recognized for its crisp, tightly packed heads; 'Romaine' (e.g., 'Cos'), prized for its crunchy texture and elongated heads; and 'Leaf' (e.g., 'Red Leaf', 'Green Leaf'), which includes loose-leaf varieties with tender leaves and mild flavors. Each type offers a range of cultivars suited for different growing conditions and culinary preferences.",

       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Lettuce seeds can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Lettuce can also be directly sown outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-drained soil and partial shade, especially in hot climates. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them according to the recommended spacing for the variety being grown. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
