      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Bok choy can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds in trays or pots filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (65-75°F). Provide bright, indirect light or use grow lights to encourage healthy seedling growth. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Bok choy can also be directly sown outdoors in early spring or late summer. Prepare a seedbed with loose, fertile soil and sow seeds 1/4 inch deep. Space seeds or thin seedlings to the desired spacing, allowing enough room for plants to grow to full size. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
