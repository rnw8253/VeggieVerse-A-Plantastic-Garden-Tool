      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Radicchio seeds can be started indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix to get a head start on the growing season. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (55-65°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Radicchio seeds should be sown directly outdoors in well-drained soil once the danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with fertile soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-8 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
