    "varieties": "Radicchio, also known as Italian chicory, comes in several varieties, each with its unique color, flavor, and texture. Common varieties of radicchio include 'Rossa di Treviso', which has elongated heads with deep red leaves and a slightly bitter flavor; 'Chioggia', known for its round heads and variegated pink and white leaves; and 'Castelfranco', prized for its creamy white leaves with pink speckles. These varieties offer options for different culinary uses and preferences.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Radicchio seeds can be started indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix to get a head start on the growing season. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (55-65°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Radicchio seeds should be sown directly outdoors in well-drained soil once the danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with fertile soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-8 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
