    "plantName": "Parsnips",
    "description": "Parsnips are root vegetables closely related to carrots and parsley. They have a sweet, nutty flavor and are commonly used in soups, stews, roasts, and purees. Parsnips are rich in nutrients, including vitamins C and K, fiber, and antioxidants. They are typically harvested in the fall after the first frost, which enhances their flavor and sweetness.",

    "varieties": "Parsnips come in several varieties, each with its unique flavor and shape. Common varieties of parsnips include 'Hollow Crown', known for its long, tapered roots and sweet flavor; 'All American', prized for its high yields and resistance to disease; and 'Gladiator', which offers smooth, uniform roots with excellent flavor. These varieties provide a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Parsnips are typically sown directly outdoors as they do not transplant well. However, if you want to get a head start on the growing season, you can start seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1/2 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (45-50°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they are well-established and the weather has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Parsnips should be sown directly outdoors in early spring or late summer, depending on the desired harvest time. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/2 inch deep and space them 2-3 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

They require regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
       "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
       "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, as they can cause forked or branched roots.",

Carefully loosen the soil around the roots with a garden fork and lift the roots from the ground. Trim the tops and brush off any excess soil. Store harvested parsnips in a cool, dark place with high humidity, such as a root cellar or refrigerator.",
