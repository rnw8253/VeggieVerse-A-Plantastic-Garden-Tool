    "varieties": "Okra, also known as lady's finger or gumbo, comes in several varieties, each with its unique pod shape, color, and flavor. Common varieties of okra include 'Clemson Spineless', known for its spineless pods and high yield; 'Annie Oakley', prized for its early maturity and disease resistance; and 'Red Burgundy', which offers deep red pods and ornamental value. These varieties provide a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Okra seeds do not transplant well, so it's best to sow them directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up. However, if you want to get a head start on the growing season, you can start seeds indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-90°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they are well-established and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Okra seeds should be sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them 12-18 inches apart in rows spaced 24-36 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Side-dress okra with a balanced fertilizer once it starts growing.",
