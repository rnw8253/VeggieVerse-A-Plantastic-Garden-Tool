        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Squash seeds can be started indoors in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-85°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Squash seeds should be sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up in the spring. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them 12-48 inches apart, depending on the variety. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "growingDescription": "Squash plants thrive in full sun and well-drained, fertile soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0. They require regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist, especially during dry periods. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Side-dress squash plants with a balanced fertilizer once they start producing fruits.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest summer squash when the fruits are young and tender, usually 6-8 inches long for most varieties. Use a sharp knife to cut the fruits from the vines. Winter squash should be harvested when the fruits reach full maturity and the rinds are hard and cannot be punctured with a fingernail. Leave a few inches of stem attached to the fruits. Store harvested squash in a cool, dry place with good ventilation. Summer squash can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week, while winter squash can be stored for several months.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest summer squash regularly to encourage continuous production. Cut the fruits from the vines using a sharp knife, taking care not to damage the plants. Winter squash should be harvested before the first frost. Use a sharp knife to cut the fruits from the vines, leaving a few inches of stem attached."
