     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Zucchini seeds are best sown directly outdoors, as they do not transplant well. However, if you want to start seeds indoors to get a head start on the growing season, you can plant them in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-85°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Zucchini seeds should be sown directly outdoors after all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1 inch deep and space them 2-3 feet apart in rows spaced 3-4 feet apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
