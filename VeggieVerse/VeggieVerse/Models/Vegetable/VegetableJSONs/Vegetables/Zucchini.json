    "varieties": "Zucchini, also known as courgette, comes in various varieties, each with its unique flavor, texture, and size. Common zucchini varieties include 'Black Beauty', known for its dark green skin and prolific fruit production; 'Golden', which offers bright yellow skin and a mild flavor; and 'Cocozelle', prized for its striped appearance and tender flesh. These varieties provide options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Zucchini seeds are best sown directly outdoors, as they do not transplant well. However, if you want to start seeds indoors to get a head start on the growing season, you can plant them in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-85°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Zucchini seeds should be sown directly outdoors after all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1 inch deep and space them 2-3 feet apart in rows spaced 3-4 feet apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
