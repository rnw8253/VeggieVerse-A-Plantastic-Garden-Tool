    "varieties": "Green beans, also known as snap beans or string beans, come in various types, each with its unique characteristics and culinary uses. Some popular green bean varieties include 'Blue Lake', known for its tender pods and classic flavor; 'Provider', prized for its early and abundant yields; 'Kentucky Wonder', recognized for its long, flavorful pods; and 'Contender', valued for its disease resistance and productivity. These varieties, among others, offer a range of options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Green beans are typically direct-sown outdoors, as they do not transplant well. However, you can start them indoors in biodegradable pots filled with seed-starting mix 2-3 weeks before the last frost date. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (65-85°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Green beans are best sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them according to the recommended distance for the variety being grown. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

Water regularly, especially during dry periods, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
       "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1-2 inches per week.",

       "storageRecommendations": "Harvest green beans when the pods are firm, crisp, and have reached the desired size. Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the pods from the plant, being careful not to damage the vines. Store harvested green beans in the refrigerator for up to a week. Wash and dry the pods before storing to remove any dirt or debris.",
       "harvestDescription": "Harvest green beans regularly to encourage continuous production. Pick the pods when they are young and tender, usually before the seeds inside have fully developed. Avoid letting the pods become overripe, as they can become tough and fibrous."
