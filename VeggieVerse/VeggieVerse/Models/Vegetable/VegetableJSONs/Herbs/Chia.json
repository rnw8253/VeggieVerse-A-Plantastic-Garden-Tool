    "varieties": "Chia (Salvia hispanica) is a species of flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae. While there aren't distinct varieties of chia like some other crops, different cultivars may vary slightly in growth habit and seed characteristics. Common cultivars include 'Mia', 'Barbara', and 'Benexia'. These cultivars may differ in traits such as seed size, color, and yield potential.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Chia seeds can be started indoors in seed trays or pots filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow the seeds evenly on the soil surface and lightly press them into the soil. Keep the soil consistently moist and place the trays in a warm, sunny location or under grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Chia seeds can also be directly sown outdoors after the last frost date in your area. Prepare a well-draining garden bed or container and sow the seeds evenly on the soil surface. Cover them lightly with a thin layer of soil and water gently. Keep the soil consistently moist until the seeds germinate.",
