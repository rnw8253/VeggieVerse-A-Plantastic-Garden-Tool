      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Bee balm seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/8 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (65-75°F). Provide ample light or use supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Bee balm seeds can also be directly sown outdoors in the spring or fall. Choose a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1/8 inch deep and space them 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "growingDescription": "Bee balm thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0. They require regular watering, especially during dry periods, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Regular watering, aiming for 1 inch per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate compost into the soil before planting to improve fertility and soil structure. Side-dress bee balm with a balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season.",
        "pruningRequirements": "Deadhead spent flowers regularly to promote continuous blooming and prevent self-seeding. Cut back stems to the base in late fall or early spring to encourage new growth and prevent the plant from becoming leggy.",
        "supportRequirements": "Bee balm may benefit from staking or support in windy areas or when grown in rich soil that promotes lush growth."

        "storageRecommendations": "Fresh bee balm flowers can be harvested as needed for culinary or medicinal use. To preserve bee balm flowers, you can dry them by hanging them upside down in a cool, dark place with good air circulation. Store dried bee balm flowers in an airtight container away from light and moisture.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest bee balm flowers when they are fully open and at their peak of fragrance and color. Cut stems with sharp pruners or scissors, leaving a few inches of stem attached. Rinse harvested flowers under cool water to remove any debris before using them."
