    "description": "Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is an annual herb native to the Mediterranean region, cultivated for its edible seeds and leaves. It has a long history of culinary and medicinal use, prized for its distinctive flavor and various health benefits. Fenugreek seeds are commonly used as a spice in Indian cuisine, while the leaves, known as methi, are used as a vegetable or herb. Fenugreek is also valued for its medicinal properties, including its ability to support digestion, regulate blood sugar levels, and promote lactation.",

    "varieties": "Fenugreek, scientifically known as Trigonella foenum-graecum, is an annual herb belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. While there are no distinct varieties of fenugreek like some other crops, different strains may vary slightly in flavor, leaf size, and growth habit.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Fenugreek seeds can be started indoors in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist. Provide bright, indirect light or supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and all danger of frost has passed.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Fenugreek seeds can also be directly sown outdoors in the garden after the last frost date in your area. Choose a location with full sun and well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 2-3 inches apart in rows spaced 6-12 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
