    "varieties": "Fenugreek, scientifically known as Trigonella foenum-graecum, is an annual herb belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. While there are no distinct varieties of fenugreek like some other crops, different strains may vary slightly in flavor, leaf size, and growth habit.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Fenugreek seeds can be started indoors in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist. Provide bright, indirect light or supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and all danger of frost has passed.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Fenugreek seeds can also be directly sown outdoors in the garden after the last frost date in your area. Choose a location with full sun and well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 2-3 inches apart in rows spaced 6-12 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
