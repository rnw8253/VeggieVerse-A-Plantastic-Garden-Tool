        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Chamomile seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds on the soil surface and press them lightly into the soil. Keep the soil consistently moist and warm (60-70°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Chamomile seeds can also be directly seeded outdoors after the last frost date in your area. Choose a location with full sun and well-drained soil. Scatter seeds on the soil surface and cover them lightly with a thin layer of soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
