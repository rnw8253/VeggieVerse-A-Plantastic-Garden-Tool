      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Chickpeas are typically directly sown outdoors as they don't transplant well. However, if you want to start them indoors, use biodegradable pots or peat pots to minimize root disturbance. Plant seeds 1-2 inches deep in well-drained soil. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide ample sunlight or use grow lights.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Chickpeas should be sown directly outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1-2 inches deep and space them 4-6 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "Water chickpea plants regularly, providing about 1 inch of water per week, and reduce watering during pod development to prevent splitting.",
        "Fertilize chickpea plants with a balanced fertilizer or compost tea at planting time and side dress with nitrogen-rich fertilizer when the plants begin to flower.",
        "Mulch around chickpea plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and reduce soil splashing, which can help prevent soil-borne diseases.",
        "Monitor plants regularly for signs of pests such as aphids, spider mites, and cutworms. Use physical barriers or insecticidal soap as needed.",
        "Inspect plants for symptoms of diseases like fusarium wilt and powdery mildew. Practice crop rotation and avoid planting chickpeas in wet or poorly drained areas.",
        "Harvest chickpeas when the pods are mature and firm, but still green. Allow the pods to dry completely before shelling to harvest the dried chickpeas.",
        "Store dried chickpeas in a cool, dry place in airtight containers to maintain freshness.",
