    "varieties": "Popcorn, scientifically known as Zea mays everta, comes in various varieties, each with its own unique kernel size, shape, and color. Common popcorn varieties include yellow, white, and multicolored kernels. Some popular varieties include 'Butterfly' for its large, fluffy kernels, 'Mushroom' for its round, compact kernels, and 'Baby Rice' for its small, tender kernels.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Popcorn is typically sown directly outdoors as it requires ample space to grow. However, if you choose to start seeds indoors, plant them in biodegradable pots to avoid disturbing the roots during transplanting. Fill the pots with seed starting mix and plant seeds 1-2 inches deep. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide ample sunlight or grow lights.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Popcorn should be planted directly outdoors after the last frost date in your area. Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1-2 inches deep and space them 8-12 inches apart in rows spaced 2-3 feet apart. Ensure adequate soil moisture during the growing season.",

Ensure consistent soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during the critical stages of pollination and kernel development. Mulching around plants can help retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Popcorn plants require regular watering, providing approximately 1-1.5 inches of water per week. Ensure even soil moisture, especially during pollination and kernel development.",
        "soilFertility": "Incorporate organic matter such as compost or aged manure into the soil before planting to improve soil fertility. Side-dress with a balanced fertilizer when plants reach 6-8 inches in height, following package instructions.",

        "timeToMaturity": "Popcorn typically matures in 75-100 days after planting, depending on the variety and growing conditions.",
        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest popcorn when kernels are fully mature and dry. Allow the ears to dry on the stalk until kernels are hard and moisture content is around 13-14%. Once harvested, remove kernels from the cob and store them in a cool, dry place in breathable containers. Properly dried popcorn can be stored for several months.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest popcorn when the kernels are fully mature and dry. Test a few kernels by pressing your fingernail into them; if they dent rather than break, they are not yet fully dry. Once ready, pull the ears gently from the stalk and allow them to air dry further in a warm, well-ventilated area before shelling."
