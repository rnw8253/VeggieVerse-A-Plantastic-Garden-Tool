        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Dandelions are typically not started indoors from seeds due to their ability to self-sow prolifically in outdoor conditions. However, if you wish to start dandelions indoors, you can collect seeds from mature plants and sow them in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist and place the containers in a sunny location.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Dandelion seeds can be directly sown outdoors in early spring or fall. Choose a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Scatter the seeds evenly over the soil surface and lightly press them into the soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until the seeds germinate.",
