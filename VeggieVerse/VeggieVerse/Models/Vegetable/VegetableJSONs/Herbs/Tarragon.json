    "varieties": "Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) primarily exists in two main varieties: French tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus var. sativa) and Russian tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus var. inodora). French tarragon is the preferred culinary variety due to its superior flavor, while Russian tarragon tends to have a coarser taste and is less aromatic. There are also other cultivars and hybrids of tarragon available.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Tarragon is best propagated from stem cuttings rather than seeds. Take stem cuttings in the spring or fall from established plants. Remove the lower leaves from the cutting and place it in a container of water or well-draining potting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide bright, indirect light until roots develop.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "If planting from seed, sow tarragon seeds directly into the garden after the danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-draining soil and full sun. Sow seeds shallowly, barely covering them with soil, and keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate.",

        "growingDescription": "Tarragon prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. It is relatively low-maintenance once established. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Water tarragon regularly, providing 1-2 inches of water per week, especially during dry periods.",
        "soilFertility": "Tarragon is not a heavy feeder and can thrive in poor to moderately fertile soil. However, incorporating compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting can provide some nutrients.",
        "pruningRequirements": "Prune tarragon regularly to encourage bushy growth and prevent legginess. Pinch off the growing tips to encourage branching. Remove any dead or yellowing leaves as needed.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest tarragon leaves as needed for culinary use. Use fresh leaves immediately for the best flavor. Alternatively, you can dry tarragon leaves by hanging them upside down in a warm, well-ventilated area until they are completely dry. Store dried tarragon leaves in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest tarragon leaves by snipping them from the plant as needed. Harvest leaves when they are young and tender for the best flavor."
