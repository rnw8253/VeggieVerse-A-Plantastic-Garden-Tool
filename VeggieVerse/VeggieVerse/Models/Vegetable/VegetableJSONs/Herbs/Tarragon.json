    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Tarragon is best propagated from stem cuttings rather than seeds. Take stem cuttings in the spring or fall from established plants. Remove the lower leaves from the cutting and place it in a container of water or well-draining potting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide bright, indirect light until roots develop.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "If planting from seed, sow tarragon seeds directly into the garden after the danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-draining soil and full sun. Sow seeds shallowly, barely covering them with soil, and keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate.",
