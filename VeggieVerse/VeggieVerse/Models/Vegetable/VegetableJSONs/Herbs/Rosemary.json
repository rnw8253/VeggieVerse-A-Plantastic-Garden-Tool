    "varieties": "Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) comes in various cultivars, each with its unique growth habits and flavors. Some common varieties include 'Arp' known for its cold-hardiness, 'Tuscan Blue' with its upright growth and strong flavor, 'Prostrate' with a trailing habit suitable for ground cover, and 'Miss Jessup's Upright' valued for its ornamental appeal.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Rosemary seeds can be challenging to germinate, so it's often easier to start with established plants. However, if you choose to start from seeds, sow them indoors in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Plant seeds shallowly, barely covering them with soil, and keep the soil consistently moist. Place the pots in a warm location with indirect sunlight.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Rosemary can also be propagated from stem cuttings. Take 4-6 inch cuttings from healthy rosemary plants and remove the lower leaves. Dip the cut end in rooting hormone and plant it in well-draining soil or a mix of perlite and vermiculite. Keep the soil consistently moist until roots develop.",

        "growingDescription": "Rosemary thrives in full sun and well-drained, slightly acidic soil with good airflow. It is drought-tolerant once established and does not require frequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Mulching around plants can help conserve moisture and suppress weeds.",

Store dried rosemary in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest rosemary sprigs by snipping them from the plant as needed. Avoid harvesting more than one-third of the plant at a time to ensure healthy growth."
