    "varieties": "Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) comes in various cultivars, each with its unique growth habits and flavors. Some common varieties include 'Arp' known for its cold-hardiness, 'Tuscan Blue' with its upright growth and strong flavor, 'Prostrate' with a trailing habit suitable for ground cover, and 'Miss Jessup's Upright' valued for its ornamental appeal.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Rosemary seeds can be challenging to germinate, so it's often easier to start with established plants. However, if you choose to start from seeds, sow them indoors in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Plant seeds shallowly, barely covering them with soil, and keep the soil consistently moist. Place the pots in a warm location with indirect sunlight.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Rosemary can also be propagated from stem cuttings. Take 4-6 inch cuttings from healthy rosemary plants and remove the lower leaves. Dip the cut end in rooting hormone and plant it in well-draining soil or a mix of perlite and vermiculite. Keep the soil consistently moist until roots develop.",

        "growingDescription": "Rosemary thrives in full sun and well-drained, slightly acidic soil with good airflow. It is drought-tolerant once established and does not require frequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Mulching around plants can help conserve moisture and suppress weeds.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Water newly planted rosemary plants regularly until established. Once established, water infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.",
        "soilFertility": "Rosemary is not heavy feeder and can thrive in poor soil. However, incorporating compost or well-aged manure into the soil before planting can provide some nutrients.",
        "pruningRequirements": "Prune rosemary regularly to maintain its shape and encourage bushy growth. Trim back leggy or woody stems and remove any dead or diseased branches. Avoid heavy pruning, as rosemary does not regenerate well from old wood.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest rosemary sprigs as needed for culinary use. Use fresh rosemary immediately for the best flavor. Alternatively, you can dry rosemary sprigs by hanging them upside down in a warm, well-ventilated area until the leaves are dry and brittle. Store dried rosemary in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest rosemary sprigs by snipping them from the plant as needed. Avoid harvesting more than one-third of the plant at a time to ensure healthy growth."
