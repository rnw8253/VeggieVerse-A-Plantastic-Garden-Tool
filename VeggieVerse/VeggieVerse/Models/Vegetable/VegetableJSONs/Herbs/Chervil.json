    "description": "Chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium) is a delicate annual herb with fern-like foliage and a mild, delicate flavor reminiscent of parsley and anise. It is commonly used in French cuisine, particularly in fines herbes blends, soups, salads, and as a garnish. Chervil is easy to grow and is prized for its fresh, bright green leaves and delicate aroma. It prefers cool, moist conditions and is often grown as a cool-season herb in spring or fall.",

    "varieties": "Chervil, also known as Anthriscus cerefolium, is a delicate annual herb with fern-like leaves and a mild, subtle flavor reminiscent of parsley and anise. While there are no distinct varieties of chervil like some other herbs, there may be slight variations in flavor and leaf appearance among different strains.",
     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Chervil seeds can be started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and cool (60-70°F). Provide ample light or use supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Chervil seeds can also be directly sown outdoors in early spring or late summer/fall. Choose a location with partial shade to full sun and well-drained, fertile soil. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-8 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
