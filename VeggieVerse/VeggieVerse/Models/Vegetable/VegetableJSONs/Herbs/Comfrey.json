    "varieties": "Comfrey, scientifically known as Symphytum officinale, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. While there are no distinct varieties of comfrey, different cultivars may vary slightly in leaf size, flower color, and growth habit. Common cultivars include 'Bocking 14' and 'Bocking 4', which are known for their high yields and sterile seeds.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Comfrey is typically propagated from root cuttings rather than seeds. However, if you have access to comfrey seeds, they can be started indoors in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist. Provide bright, indirect light until seedlings emerge.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Comfrey root cuttings are best planted directly outdoors in the garden. Choose a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Plant root cuttings horizontally in the soil, with the growing buds facing upward. Space multiple cuttings 24-36 inches apart to allow for spreading growth.",
