       "storageRecommendations": "Harvest calendula flowers when they are fully open but before they start to fade. Cut flowers in the morning after the dew has dried but before the sun is too hot. Calendula flowers can be used fresh immediately or dried for later use. To dry calendula, hang the flowers upside down in a well-ventilated area out of direct sunlight. Once completely dry, store the flowers in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.",
       "harvestDescription": "Harvest calendula flowers by cutting the stems just above a set of leaves. Use scissors or pruning shears to avoid damaging the plant. Rinse harvested flowers under cool water to remove any dirt or debris before using them in recipes or drying them for storage."
