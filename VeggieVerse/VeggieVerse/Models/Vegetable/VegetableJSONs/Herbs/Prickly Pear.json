      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Prickly pear cacti are typically propagated from pads rather than seeds. To propagate indoors, select healthy pads from mature prickly pear plants and allow them to callus for a few days. Plant the callused pads in well-draining cactus potting mix, burying them halfway into the soil. Water sparingly until roots develop.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Prickly pear cacti can be planted outdoors in regions with a warm, arid climate. Select a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant the pads directly into the ground, burying them halfway into the soil. Water sparingly until roots establish, then gradually reduce watering as the plant becomes established.",
