    "varieties": "Prickly pear, also known as Opuntia, encompasses several species and varieties of cacti with edible fruits. Some common varieties include Opuntia ficus-indica, Opuntia robusta, Opuntia engelmannii, and Opuntia phaeacantha. Each variety may have slightly different fruit characteristics, such as size, color, and flavor.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Prickly pear cacti are typically propagated from pads rather than seeds. To propagate indoors, select healthy pads from mature prickly pear plants and allow them to callus for a few days. Plant the callused pads in well-draining cactus potting mix, burying them halfway into the soil. Water sparingly until roots develop.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Prickly pear cacti can be planted outdoors in regions with a warm, arid climate. Select a sunny location with well-drained soil. Plant the pads directly into the ground, burying them halfway into the soil. Water sparingly until roots establish, then gradually reduce watering as the plant becomes established.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest prickly pear fruits when they are fully ripe and easily detach from the plant. Use gloves to handle the fruits, as the spines can cause irritation. Store harvested fruits in a cool, dry place for short-term storage, or process them into jams, jellies, or syrups for longer-term storage.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest prickly pear fruits when they are fully ripe and easily detach from the plant. Use a pair of tongs to gently twist the fruit off the pad. Use gloves to handle the fruits, as the spines can cause irritation."
