     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Cilantro seeds can be started indoors 3-4 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in biodegradable pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (60-70°F). Provide ample light or use supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Cilantro seeds can also be directly sown outdoors in early spring or fall. Choose a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-8 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
