    "varieties": "Borage, also known as starflower, comes in various varieties, each with its unique flavor and appearance. Common borage varieties include 'Blue Borage', known for its vibrant blue flowers and cucumber-like flavor; 'White Borage', which offers delicate white flowers with a similar flavor profile to blue borage; and 'Variegated Borage', prized for its variegated foliage and edible flowers.

      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Borage is best sown directly outdoors as it does not transplant well. However, if you want to start seeds indoors to get a head start on the growing season, you can plant them in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (60-70°F). Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and the weather has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Borage seeds should be sown directly outdoors after the last frost date in your area. Choose a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
