      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Salvia seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds shallowly, barely covering them with soil, and keep the soil consistently moist. Place the pots in a warm location with indirect sunlight.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Salvia can also be propagated from stem cuttings or divided from established plants. Take 4-6 inch stem cuttings from healthy sage plants, remove the lower leaves, and dip the cut end in rooting hormone. Plant the cuttings in well-draining soil or a mix of perlite and vermiculite. Keep the soil consistently moist until roots develop.",

Alternatively, you can dry salvia flowers or leaves by hanging them upside down in a warm, well-ventilated area until they are dry and brittle. Store dried salvia in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.",
