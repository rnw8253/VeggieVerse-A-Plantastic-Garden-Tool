    "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Lavender seeds can be started indoors in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds on the soil surface and lightly press them into the soil. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide bright, indirect light or supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the last frost date in your area.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Lavender seeds can also be directly sown outdoors in the garden after the last frost date. Choose a location with full sun and well-drained soil. Scatter seeds over the soil surface and lightly rake them in. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest lavender flowers when they are fully open and at their peak fragrance. Cut flower spikes just above the foliage using sharp scissors or pruning shears. Use fresh flowers immediately, or dry them for later use. To dry lavender, hang the stems upside down in small bunches in a warm, well-ventilated area out of direct sunlight. Once fully dried, store the flowers in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest lavender flowers in the morning when the oils are most concentrated. Snip flower spikes just above the foliage, taking care not to remove too much of the plant's growth."
