      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Thyme seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds shallowly, barely covering them with soil, and keep the soil consistently moist. Place the pots in a warm location with indirect sunlight.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Thyme can also be directly sown outdoors after the danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-draining soil and full sun. Scatter seeds over the prepared soil and lightly cover them with a thin layer of soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate.",

        "growingDescription": "Thyme prefers well-draining soil and full sun. Once established, it is relatively low-maintenance. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, but avoid overwatering as thyme is drought-tolerant once established. Mulch around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain even soil temperature.",

Store dried thyme leaves in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.",
        "harvestDescription": "Harvest thyme leaves by snipping them from the plant as needed. Harvest leaves when they are young and tender for the best flavor."
