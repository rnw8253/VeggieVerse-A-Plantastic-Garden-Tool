        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Thyme seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds shallowly, barely covering them with soil, and keep the soil consistently moist. Place the pots in a warm location with indirect sunlight.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Thyme can also be directly sown outdoors after the danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with well-draining soil and full sun. Scatter seeds over the prepared soil and lightly cover them with a thin layer of soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until seeds germinate.",
