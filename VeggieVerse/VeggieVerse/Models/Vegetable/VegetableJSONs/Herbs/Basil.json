    "varieties": "Basil comes in various varieties, each with its unique flavor, aroma, and culinary uses. Common basil varieties include 'Genovese', known for its classic sweet flavor and large leaves, ideal for making pesto; 'Thai', prized for its spicy, licorice-like flavor and small, narrow leaves, commonly used in Thai cuisine; and 'Lemon', which offers a refreshing citrusy flavor, perfect for adding a zing to dishes. These varieties provide options suited for different culinary preferences and growing conditions.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Basil is best started from seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-75°F). Provide ample light or use supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Basil can also be directly seeded outdoors once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed. Choose a location with full sun and well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-12 inches apart in rows spaced 12-18 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
