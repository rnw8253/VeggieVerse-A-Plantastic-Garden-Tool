    "description": "Edamame, also known as green soybeans, are young soybean pods harvested at the peak of their ripeness. They are a popular snack and culinary ingredient in East Asian cuisine and are valued for their tender texture and nutty flavor. Edamame is rich in protein, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals, making it a nutritious addition to any diet.",

    "varieties": "Edamame, also known as immature soybeans, is a type of soybean harvested at the peak of ripening, while the beans are still green and soft. While there are no distinct varieties of edamame, different cultivars of soybeans may be used for edamame production, selected for their flavor, texture, and yield.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Edamame is typically sown directly outdoors in the garden as it does not transplant well. However, if you wish to start seeds indoors for an earlier start, sow them in biodegradable pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist. Transplant seedlings outdoors once they have developed several true leaves and all danger of frost has passed.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Edamame seeds should be sown directly outdoors in the garden after the last frost date in your area. Choose a location with full sun and well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and space them 2-3 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
