     "sowingAndPlanting": {
       "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Catnip seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Plant seeds in biodegradable pots or trays filled with seed-starting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist and warm (70-75°F). Provide ample light or use supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors once all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.",
       "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Catnip seeds can also be directly seeded outdoors after the last frost date in your area. Choose a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 18-24 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
