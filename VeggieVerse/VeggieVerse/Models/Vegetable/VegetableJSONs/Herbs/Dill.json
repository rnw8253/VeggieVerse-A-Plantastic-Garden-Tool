      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Dill is best sown directly outdoors as it does not transplant well. However, if you prefer to start dill indoors, sow seeds in biodegradable pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and keep the soil consistently moist. Provide bright, indirect light until seedlings emerge.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Dill seeds can be sown directly outdoors in early spring after the last frost date in your area. Choose a location with full sun and well-drained soil. Scatter the seeds evenly over the soil surface and lightly press them into the soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until the seeds germinate.",
