    "description": "Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is an iconic annual flowering plant known for its large, daisy-like flowers and towering stalks. Native to North America, sunflowers have been cultivated for thousands of years for their ornamental beauty, nutritious seeds, and versatile oil. Sunflowers come in a variety of sizes, colors, and forms, making them popular choices for gardens, landscapes, and cut flower arrangements. In addition to their aesthetic appeal, sunflowers also provide valuable resources for pollinators and wildlife.",

    "varieties": "Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) come in a wide range of varieties, including tall varieties that can reach heights of 6-12 feet or more, as well as dwarf or branching varieties that are more compact. Some popular varieties include 'Giant Russian', 'Mammoth', 'Lemon Queen', 'Autumn Beauty', and 'Teddy Bear'. Each variety may have unique characteristics such as flower color, size, and growth habit.",
      "sowingAndPlanting": {
        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Sunflowers are best sown directly outdoors as they do not transplant well. However, if you choose to start them indoors, use biodegradable pots to minimize root disturbance. Plant seeds 1 inch deep in rich, well-draining soil. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide plenty of sunlight.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Sow sunflower seeds directly into the garden after the danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 55°F. Choose a location with full sun and well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and 6 inches apart. Water the seeds thoroughly after planting.",

        "growingDescription": "Sunflowers thrive in full sun and well-draining soil. Once established, they are relatively low-maintenance plants. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, but avoid overwatering as this can cause root rot. Mulch around the base of the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.",
        "wateringNeeds": "Water sunflowers regularly, providing 1-2 inches of water per week.",
        "soilFertility": "Sunflowers are not heavy feeders, but they benefit from well-amended soil. Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility.",
        "pruningRequirements": "Sunflowers do not require pruning, but you can remove spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming and prevent self-seeding if desired.",
        "supportRequirements": "Tall varieties of sunflowers may require staking or support to prevent them from toppling over in strong winds. You can also grow them near a fence or trellis for support."

        "storageRecommendations": "Harvest sunflower heads when the back of the flower head turns yellow and the seeds are plump and developed. Cut the flower heads with a few inches of stem attached. Hang them upside down in a warm, dry location with good air circulation to dry. Once the seeds are fully dry, remove them from the flower head and store them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.",
        "harvestDescription": "To harvest sunflower seeds, cut the flower heads when the back of the flower head turns yellow and the seeds are plump and developed. Rub the seeds out of the flower head with your hands or a stiff brush."
