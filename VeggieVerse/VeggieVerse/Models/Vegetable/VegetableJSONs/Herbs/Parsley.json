    "varieties": "Parsley, scientifically known as Petroselinum crispum, is a biennial herb that is commonly cultivated as an annual. There are two main varieties of parsley: curly leaf parsley (Petroselinum crispum var. crispum) and flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley (Petroselinum crispum var. neapolitanum). Curly leaf parsley has tightly curled, bright green leaves and a milder flavor, while flat-leaf parsley has flat, broad leaves and a stronger flavor.",

        "sowingIndoorsDescription": "Parsley seeds can be started indoors in pots or trays filled with well-draining potting mix. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and cover lightly with soil. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide bright, indirect light or supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the last frost date in your area.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Parsley seeds can also be directly sown outdoors in the garden after the last frost date. Choose a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-8 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
