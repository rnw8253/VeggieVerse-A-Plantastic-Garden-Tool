Keep the soil consistently moist and provide bright, indirect light or supplemental grow lights. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the last frost date in your area.",
        "sowingOutdoorsDescription": "Parsley seeds can also be directly sown outdoors in the garden after the last frost date. Choose a location with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and space them 6-8 inches apart. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge.",
